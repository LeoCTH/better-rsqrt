# Better `rsqrt`
**N.B.:** The accuracy benefits of this is negligible at best, so don't expect anything big to happen. This is created
purely because I want to, and I can. 

Replaces the constant Minecraft uses in their [fast reciprocal square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root)
(also known as `InvSqrt` or `rsqrt`) functions, to yield better accuracy:

| Function | Original Value | More Accurateâ„¢ Value |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
|`fastInverseSqrt(float)`| `0x5f3759df` | `0x5f375a86`|
|`fastInverseSqrt(double)`| `0x5fe6eb50c7b537aa` | `0x5fe6eb50c7b537a9`|

Since Minecraft only use these functions in rendering, this "fix" should not affect world generation or other functions
that rely on the vanilla result to yield expected results.
